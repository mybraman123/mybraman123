Hi my name is Miranda Braman. 
I currently live in Orange County, California. I am in my second to last term in the data science program.
I am hoping to get a PhD in Mathematical, computational, and systems biology after I finish my masters.
In my free time I like spending my time outdoors and playing with my red doberman puppy Giulia!
